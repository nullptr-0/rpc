Please note that the following file are not included in the current version of rpc framework:

- function.cpp
- custom_type.h
These 2 files are given examples of how user functions the rpc framework should be provided with.

- rpc.cpp
This is an example of how the rpc-registered user functions should be called on the client-side code.

- rpc-client-impl.cpp
- rpc-function.hpp
- rpc-server-impl.cpp
These 3 files are automatically generated by rpcc and the only usage is for rpc-server and rpc-client builds.

- json.hpp
This is the single header version of nlohmann/json library

- all content except ecc.hpp in ./crypto
These files are from libtom/libtommath, we made a few changes to fit it in though.
